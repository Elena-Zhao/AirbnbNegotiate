The calendar is open on these days and I am wondering if it is still available? A little bit more about myself: I am a graduate student from Milan, Italy and study Communication Design. I am fond of exploring cultures and visual arts around the world.I will visit Boston a few times this year to work on a project with a local school. I will be there with a collegue of mine.  Because my schedule match perfectly with the opening in your calendar, I am wondering if you would be willing to lower the rate to $80/night? I would be willing to make the booking immediately if the price is ok with you.\n"
